Level 3: Weave Mirage
You learn to weave illusionary mirages to protect yourself and your allies.
As a bonus action you may expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to give one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself a Mirage Veil.
The next time that creature would be dealt damage by an attack which targets them within the next minute, they roll your Bardic Inspiration die.
If the result is 3 or greater, that damage is reduced to 0 and the creature is not affected by any additional effects which the attack may incur on a hit.
Regardless of the result of the roll, the Mirage Veil is then removed. A creature can only have one Mirage Veil at a time.

Level 3: Hide in Plain Sight
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you may make it as a Charisma check instead.

Level 6: Cloak of Mirrors
When you cast a level 1+ spell which gives a creature the Invisible condition or grants it an illusionary appearance via Disguise Self, Seeming, or any similar effect, that creature also gains a Mirage Veil.

Level 6: Position is Relative
When a creature evades an attack using a Mirage Veil you created, that creature may use its reaction to immediately move 15 feet in any direction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Level 14: Illusionary Ambush
Whenever a creature that has a Mirage Veil you created hits a creature with a weapon attack, that attack deals additional Psychic damage equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum of 1).
