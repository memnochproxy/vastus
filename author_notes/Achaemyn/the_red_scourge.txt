The Red Scourge

In the year 25 BCE, the first cases of The Red Scourge appeared in the outskirts of the Achaemyn Empire.
Manifesting as a cloud of red spores, this plague latched onto the strands of weave connecting creatures around it and slowly consumed them, rendering its victims empty husks.
Because this plague attacked the very weave itself, it proved a threat to all creatures, even undead and constructs.
Initially, the scourge spread slowly.
Small communities at the edge of the empire would periodically go dark, but it wasn’t until the plague reached Tor’Urik the capital city of the Nalbin Province that the threat could be ignored no longer.
Soon, thousands of refugees were fleeing to neighboring cities, and the plague was slowly brought further and further inward towards Achaem.
